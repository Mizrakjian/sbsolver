# SBSolver.py

This utility scrapes the NYT Spelling Bee web game and displays today's possible words and official answers.

---

I wrote this when I couldn't complete the puzzle or find any solvers online that could help with the game's unique format.  I saw early on that the answers were embedded in the game site code, but created the word-finding code anyway to to finish the project the way I originally planned.

## Todo:
* Add feature to retrieve, display, and locally cache short word definitions.
