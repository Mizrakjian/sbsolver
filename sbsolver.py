SBSolver.py

This utility scrapes the NYT Spelling Bee web game and displays today's
possible words (found words that match the criteria of the game) and the
site's official answers.

-----

I wrote this when I couldn't complete the puzzle or find any solvers
online that could help with the game's unique format.  I saw early on that
the answers were embedded in the game site code, but created the word-finding
code anyway to to finish the project the way I originally planned.

Implemented 08/2023:
  *  Add feature to retrieve, display, and locally cache short word definitions.
  *  Use async io to improve definition fetch time.
  *  Restructure project to modularize functionality and improve readability.

TODO:
    Over time turn into a package?
